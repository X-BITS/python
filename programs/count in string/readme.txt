========
You are given a string S containing lowercase English alphabets and a character k.  
========
Task
========
Count the number of occurrences of k in S.

========
Example
========
Assumptions
-----------
S = "abdbs"
k = "b"

Approach
--------
You can see that the number of occurrences of b in S is 2. Hence, the answer is 2.

Function description
====================
Complete the solve function which takes a string S and a character k as the argument and returns the number of occurrences of k in S:

S: Represents the string
k: Represents the character

Input format
------------
The first line contains a single integer T, which denotes the number of test cases. T also specifies the number of times you have to run the solve function on a different set of inputs.

For each test case:
-------------------
The first line contains a string S.
The second line contains the character k.
Output format
--------------
For each test case, print a single line representing the number of occurrences of k in S.
